# hazardLab

Hypothetically it's a home page that details the shenanigans I'm up to. [***Enter if ye dare***](https://hazardlab.github.io/hazardLab/).

(In practice, we'll see how much shenanigan-ing I actually get into. In fact, I'd go so far as to currently just call this place a kiddie sandbox. No evil lab yet, as much as I'd like for it to be.)
