    <p>Welcome to the <b>hazardLab</b>.</p>
    
    <p>This will presumably become a space for documenting the things I'm learning and experimenting on, and more importantly in the future, it will be the home to <i>dark shenanigans</i>.</p>
    
    <p>Things are pretty sparse right now, but I'm confident things will clutter up nicely as I start getting my fingers in these guts.</p>
